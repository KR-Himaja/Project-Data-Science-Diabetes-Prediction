**DIABETES PREDICTION**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:** 
Diabetes is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, impacting millions of Americans each year and exerting a significant financial burden on the economy. Diabetes is a serious chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effectively regulate levels of glucose in the blood, and can lead to reduced quality of life and life expectancy.

- Total: 38.4 million people have diabetes (11.6% of the US population)
- Diagnosed: 29.7 million people, including 29.4 million adults
- Undiagnosed: 8.7 million people (22.8% of adults are undiagnosed)
- Prediabetes: Total: 97.6 million people aged 18 years or older have prediabetes (38.0% of the adult US population) 65 years or older: 27.2 million people aged 65 years or older (48.8%) have prediabetes


**OBJECTIVES:**
- Optimize Diabetes Prediction Model for Toddlers to Teenagers
- Minimize False Positives to Avoid Unnecessary Stress and Medical Procedures

By reducing false positives, we can:
- Avoid causing unnecessary stress and anxiety for healthy individuals
- Prevent unnecessary medical procedures and lifestyle changes
- Encourage individuals who may be at risk to seek further confirmation and testing
- Enable earlier detection and treatment of true diabetes cases in the general population.


**DATA DICTIONARY:**
The data contains the following attributes:
Categorical:
BMI; GenHlth; MentHlth; PhysHlth; Age; Income
Numerical:
Diabetes_012: Category of Diabetes (0- No Diabetes, 1- Pre-diabetes, 2- Diabetes); HighBP; HighChol; CholCheck; Smoker; HeartDiseaseorAttack; AnyHealthcare; Sex; Stroke; HvyAlcoholConsumption; NoDocbcCost; Age; Education; Income


**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- Implement the Logistic Regression model for diabetes prediction, prioritizing precision and accuracy
- Optimize model parameters to reduce false positives and improve patient outcomes
- Consider integrating the model into existing healthcare systems to enable early detection and treatment.
